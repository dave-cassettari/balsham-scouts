		<h1>We're replacing the Hut</h1>

		<p>We are raising money to replace our existing hut.</p>
		<p>Our first target is <strong>&pound;35,000</strong> which will allow us to apply for grants. In total we need <strong>&pound;75,000</strong>.</p>

				<h2><i class="fa fa-fw fa-bullseye"></i> The Target</h2>

				<p>The total cost of rebuilding the Scout Hut is now expected to be about £75,000. This breaks down into:</p>

				<img class="thermometer" src="http://thermometer.fund-raising-ideas-center.com/thermometer.php?currency=pound&goal=35000&current=31345&color=red&size=medium" />

				<ul>
					<li>£8,000 for clearancing the existing building and base</li>
					<li>£5,000 for a new concrete base</li>
					<li>£52,000 for the new building</li>
					<li>£10,000 for the internal fittings and fixtures</li>
				</ul>

				<h2><i class="fa fa-fw fa-check-square-o"></i> How are we doing?</h2>

				<p>As of the end of September 2015 we had achieved:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>£23,345 - total money raised</li>
					<li>£2,500 - additional monies promised from commercial supporters</li>
					<li>£5,500 - target from fundraising during 2015/16</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>£31,345 - Total to date. Just £3,655 to go!</strong></p>

				<h2><i class="fa fa-fw fa-thumbs-o-up"></i> Thank you for your support!</h2>

				<p>We have received large personal donations, contributions from a number of commercial companies and a significant donation from the Balsham Ploughmen over the past year. All these have increased the money raised significantly. A big thank you to you all!</p>

				<p><strong>Does your company make contributions to local charities - would they support us? Every little helps!</strong></p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-lg-5">
				<h3>Extra help</h3>

				<p>We have had several offers of non financial help, including materials from Ridgeons, such as sanitary ware, and professional services from electricians and builders within the village.</p>
				<p>We are expecting to re-use the existing kitchen cupboards and other fittings, which were only replaced in 2011.</p>
				<p>But we can always do with extra help, especially in the fit out stage.</p>

				<h3>Applying for grants</h3>

				<p>The Scout Group will apply for grants to meet the outstanding target.</p>
				<p>The most likely sources are those run through the Cambridge Community Fund, especially the Amey Cespa grant for the capital cost of the building and the Wadlow Wind Farm grants as a contribution to the internal fittings.</p>

				<h3>Timeframes</h3>

				<p>The plan is to submit grant applications September 2015/March 2016.</p>
				<p>If we are successful, the hut will be removed Easter next year, with the new build taking place in the summer.</p>

		<h1>Our History</h1>

		<p>Balsham Scouts are over a hundred years old</p>

				<p>The Cubs and Scouts of the 1st Balsham Scout Group are celebrating the anniversary of the first Scout Troop in the village. The evidence for this comes from a Balsham Review in 1976 in which there was an article giving a short history of Balsham Scouts. The article is reproduced below.</p>

				<h2>BALSHAM SCOUT GROUP – A SHORT HISTORY</h2>

				<p>Three main factors made the writer interested to know more about the history of Scouting in Balsham; they were (i) The reforming of the Balsham Scout Group (ii) This year being the Cub/Scout Movement Diamond Jubilee year (it was originally formed as Wolf Cubs in 1916) (iii) Cambridgeshire were honoured by an official visit by the Chief Scout, the only other official visit was by Lord Baden Powell before the 1939-45 war. Granta District (comprising ten Scout Groups, of which Balsham is one) were interested in a possible link of the past with the present.</p>

				<p>Searching for such a link accidentally began at the Scouts Open Evening last autumn, when Kerry Lambert (a scout from 1914 – 1925) brought a photograph along showing Balsham Scouts performing gymnastics in front of Lord Baden Powell during his visit. Kerry clearly remembered all the scouts on the photograph, many of whom are still living in and around Balsham. There were thirteen scouts in the troop at the time in the early 1920’s. The following are members living in the area shown on the photograph:- Charlie Lambert (Abington); Harry Lambert (Letchworth); Kerry Lambert (Balsham); Arthur Gray (Balsham); John Gray (Haverhill); Tom Osbourn (Linton); Walter Beeton (Huddersfield?); Sid Newman (London?); Bob Diggins (Clare). The remainder, now deceased, were Leslie Beeton, Bill Gabbeday, Charlie Carter and Fred Colville.</p>

				<p>The Scout Master at this time was Martin Slater who lived at Grange Farm. He also led the West Wratting Troop. Three and possibly six of the above scouts obtained their King’s Scout awards under his guidance.</p>

				<p>In my attempt to find more information at the time of the Chief Scout’s visit, imagine my surprise when one very senior Balsham citizen said he was in the forces, but had been a founder member of the troop in about 1910. The Troop used to meet in the Club Room, which was situated where the Long Thatch cottage garage now stands. A point of interest is that this building is now the store room attached to the Church Institute, which again is housing Scout equipment. From the Club Room the troop moved to the Old Maltings; here they had a shooting range, also gymnastic and boxing equipment.</p>

				<p>Kerry Lambert was a scout for eleven years until 1925, and during the First World War, he and five others became Sea Scouts helping the coastguard to patrol the coastline at Osmington, Eastbourne and Blackpool. He maintained contact by assisting Martin Slater for a further two years. It was about 1928 when Martin Slater went to Kenya where he became Chief Scout, later returning to Gt. Britain and renewing his interest with the West Wratting Scouts at their 1937/8 summer camp held at Southwold.</p>

				<p>S/Ldr. Thompson became headmaster for Balsham during 1927/8. He led the troop until 1935 when he moved to Fen Drayton, where he still lives in the Old School House. He was followed by the late Leslie Beeton, who was in charge until 1938, when the troop disbanded, many scouts transferring to West Wratting under the guidance of Mr. Moore, presently living in Weston Colville, until they also discontinued owing to World War II.</p>

				<p>Leslie Beeton also formed the first Balsham Wolf Cub pack somewhere around 1933, when they held their meetings in the Old Maltings. Mrs. Cyrankowski followed as leader of the pack until they too disbanded during 1939/40 and it was in this period the pack won a Sports Competition Shield, beating all other Cambridgeshire Cub Packs.</p>

				<p>We finally arrive at 1976 when, with many memories, three former Balsham Scouts who had been introduced to Lord Baden Powell, were presented to Sir William Gladstone, the present Chief Scout, during his visit to the Abington Camp site. The three forming the link with past and present were Kerry Lambert, Charlie Lambert and John Gray.</p>
